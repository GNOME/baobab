  <title>Scan Remote Folder</title>

  <p>This assumes the reader knows when to use the communication protocols. 
  By the end of this page, the reader will be able to scan remote folders.</p></comment>

  <p>Maybe you are an admin of an Intranet file server and one day you are greeted with 
  an urgent notice that nobody in the company can save any folder on it because the disks are completely full. 
  You can also may need to trim down the size of a server to get its filesystem to fit on another
  server so that you can move it from a physical server to a virtual server. Whichever can be the case,
  you can scan remotely from other computer.</p> 

  <note style="advanced">
    <p>Make sure your remote computer is in the same network of the server and your account has the local permissions.</p>
