    <p>This assumes the reader knows when to use the communication protocols.
    By the end of this page, the reader will be able to scan remote
    folders.</p>

  <p>You can use <app>baobab</app> to scan folders shared over a network.</p>

  <p>Maybe you are the admin of an intranet file server, and one day you notice
  that nobody in the company can save files to it because the disks are
  completely full. In this case, it is useful to be able to scan remotely from
  another computer. </p>

  <p>To start scanning, select <guiseq><gui>Analyzer</gui><gui>Scan Remote
  Folder</gui></guiseq> from the menu, or click <gui>Scan a remote folder</gui>
  in the toolbar.</p>

  <p>Scanning over a network may be slow.</p>

  <p>Right-click on any folder and select <gui>Open Folder</gui> to browse all
  the folders inside, or <gui>Move to trash</gui> to move your folder to
  <file>Trash</file>.</p>
  
  <p>Choose one of following protocols:</p>

  <list>
    <item><p><link xref="ssh">SSH</link> (Secure Shell) is a protocol which lets
    you access other folders from another computer over the network. It uses a
    secure remote login because it is not possible to discover users and
    passwords.</p></item>

    <item><p><link xref="ftp">FTP (with login)</link> (File Transfer Protocol)
    with login, lets you share and transfer folders reliably and efficiently
    from remote computers. In this case a user account is required.</p></item>

    <item><p><link xref="ftp">Public FTP</link> lets you share files without the
    need to log in with a user name and password. The server creates an
    anonymous user to make the connection.</p></item>

    <item><p><link xref="windows-share">Windows Share</link> lets you view and
    manage folders used in your Windows network. You can do Windows shares from
    a Linux machine.</p></item>

    <item><p><link xref="web-dav">WebDAV (HTTP)</link> (Web-based Distributed
    Authoring and Versioning methods of Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTP) lets
    you collaborate with other users in editing and managing documents over the
    network. These folders are stored on World Wide Web servers.</p></item>

    <item><p><link xref="web-dav">Secure WebDAV (HTTPS)</link>: Secure WebDAV
    ensures encryption of transfered data (WebDAV over HTTPS will be
    used).</p></item>

    <item><p><link xref="custom-location">Custom Location</link>: enables you
    to access a particular function from the folder manager.</p></item>
  </list>

    <p>Custom Location needs a better explanation.</p>
