  <title>Error when scanning</title>

  <p>When scanning you might see a message <gui>Could not scan /… or some of the
  folders it contains</gui> at the top of <app>Disk Usage Analyzer</app> window.
  This error appears because you don't have the required permissions to access
  some files due to restrictions set on the target system. The files you can't
  access won't be used to compute the <link xref="views">chart</link>
  representing the disk usage, hence the result reported may be wrong.</p>

  <p>Not having access to all files and directories is perfectly common thought
  so there is nothing you can do about this error.</p>

  <note style="info"><p><app>Disk Usage Analyzer</app> uses command
  <cmd>du</cmd> to create the detailled view of the use of storage, and needs
  you have read permission on files and execute permission of directories.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, filesystem disk usage on the use command <cmd>df</cmd>
  for disk utilisation on the main window which relies on the filesystem and not
  on file permissions.</p></note>
