    <p>This assumes the reader knows how to start Disk Usage Manager. By the

  <p><app>Disk Usage Analyzer</app> is a graphical scanner application for the
  GNOME Desktop. It uses charts to graphically represent your usage of hard
  disk space, including available space.</p>

  <p>It scans and displays the volume of folders, the whole file system or
  what you specifically request. You can scan
  <link xref="scan-file-system">the whole filesystem</link>,
  <link xref="scan-home">your <file>Home</file> folder</link>,
  <link xref="scan-folder">another folder on the system</link> or
  <link xref="scan-remote">a remote folder</link>.</p>

  <p><app>Disk Usage Analyzer</app> also automatically detects any changes that
  are made to your <file>Home</file> folder, including any mounted or
  unmounted devices.</p>

  <p>By default, the results are shown as a <link xref="view-ring"><gui>ring
  chart</gui></link>, which shows each folder is displayed as a differently
  colored part or a ring, or you can also use to the <link
  xref="view-tree"><gui>treemap chart</gui></link>, where folders are shown as
  rectangles. Both views reflect the volume of each folder and the directory
  structure in the chart.</p>
