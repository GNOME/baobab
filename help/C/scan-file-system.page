   <p>This assumes the reader knows what are the folders that belongs to the file system. 
   By the end of this page, the reader will be able to scan a full file system.</p></comment>
   
   <p>Maybe you got a warning message saying “Low Disk Space” while you are trying to    
   download an application or while you trying to create or to copy a folder, and you 
   do not know which are the folders or programs that are taking up most space in your hard disk. 
   You can use Scan File system because it provides you a visual representation of the capacity 
   and usage of every single folder that your hard disk has.</p>

   <p>You can scan filesystem, by doing one of these alternatives:</p>
   <list>
     <item><p>Select <guiseq><gui>Analyzer</gui><gui>Scan filesystem</gui></guiseq> from the menu.</p></item>
     <item><p>Click <gui>Scan filesystem</gui> in the toolbar.</p></item>
     <item><p>Press <keyseq><key>CTRL</key><key>F</key></keyseq>.</p></item>
   </list>

  <note style="advanced">
    <p><app>Disk Usage Analyzer</app> will display sizes in the directory tree as 
    <link xref="allocated-space">allocted space</link>. 
    This means that the displayed sizes refer to the actual disk usage and not 
    to the apparent directory size.</p>
  </note>

  <p>The results may be useful in deciding which folders compress, which applications to uninstall, 
  or which folders can be
  <link href="help:gnome-help/files-delete">deleted</link> or
  <link href="help:gnome-help/files-copy">moved</link>, to free up space on the
  hard disk. You can also use them to estimate how much space would be needed
  for a <link href="help:gnome-help/backup-how">backup</link> of your
  <file>File System</file> directory.</p>

  <note style="tip">
    <p>Click the <gui>Stop</gui> in the toolbar to cancel the current, or <gui>Refresh</gui> 
    to repeat the last scan.</p>
