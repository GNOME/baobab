  <p>This assumes the reader knows how to use the nautilus to browse folders. 
  By the end of this page, the reader will be able to scan any folder inside your home, 
  on external devices or across the computer.</p></comment>

  <p>If you have many folders inside one, and maybe you want to reorganize all the structure 
  of this because it is too big or quite older; you probably need to found them to make your 
  system run smoothly.</p>

  <p>You can scan a folder by doing one of these alternatives:</p>

  <list>
     <item><p>Select <guiseq><gui>Analyzer</gui><gui>Scan Folder</gui></guiseq> from the menu.</p></item>
     <item><p>Click <gui>Scan a folder</gui> in the toolbar.</p></item>
     <item><p>Press <keyseq><key>CTRL</key><key>O</key></keyseq>.</p></item>
  </list>

  <note style="tip">
    <p>Click the <gui>Stop</gui> in the toolbar to cancel the current, or <gui>Refresh</gui> 
    to repeat the  last scan.</p>
  </note> 

  <p>The results may be useful in deciding which folders compress, which applications to uninstall, 
  or which folders can be
  <link href="help:gnome-help/files-delete">deleted</link> or
  <link href="help:gnome-help/files-copy">moved</link>, to free up space on the
  hard disk. You can also use them to estimate how much space would be needed
  for a <link href="help:gnome-help/backup-how">backup</link> of your
  <file>folder</file>.</p>

  <p>Right click on any folder and select <gui>Open Folder</gui> to browse all the folders inside, 
    or <gui>Move to trash</gui> to move your folder to <file>Trash</file>.</p>
