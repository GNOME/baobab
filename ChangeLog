	Patch contributed by Eduardo Lima <elima@igalia.com>, bug #530512

	Implemented a new treemap object and moved into the main window,
	now we can select with a combobox in the main window which graph
	we want: ringschart or treemap. We have used the ringschart code
	in order to create a new abstract class and the new treemap just
	inherits from it and changes the rendering, in the near future we
	will change the ringschart in order to use this new abstract
	class.

	Removed files, code and options in the menu that were used to show
	the old treemap. Notice we have removed GnomeCanvas dependency
	which was removed in the configure.ac file

        * src/baobab-chart.h:
        * src/baobab-treemap.c:
        * src/baobab-treemap.h:
	New objects, the chart is the new abstract class, the treemap is
	the new graphical representation, treemap inherits from chart. As
	we said before the code from chart is copied from ringschart, in
	the near future we must change ringschart in order to inherit also
	from chart.

2008-05-11 Alejandro G. Castro <acastro@igalia.com>

	* src/baobab-ringschart.c: Added a new extended timeout for the
	subfolders tooltips. A memory leak and some small style
	modifications.
	(draw_tooltips): extended the condition for drawing the subfolders
	tooltips, we do not draw them until the second timeout.
	(draw_folder_tip): Fixed a memory leak.
	(baobab_ringschart_no_pointer_motion): Added a second timeout
	where we set to TRUE the draw_children_tooltips variable.	
	
2008-05-11 Alejandro G. Castro <acastro@igalia.com>

	* src/baobab.c:

	Santamaria <psantamaria@igalia.com>, Jacobo Aragunde
	<jaragunde@igalia.com> and Eduardo Lima <elima@igalia.com>
	
	Enhancement to the ringschart widget, added multiple tooltips
	support (bug #421473)

	* src/baobab.c:
	(baobab_scan_location): We set the max depth after scanning in
	order to zoom the graphic as much as possible.
	(baobab_subfolderstips_toggled): This function is a callback that
	manages changes in the gconf key that controls the subfolders
	tips.
	(baobab_init): Monitor the gconf subfolders tooltips key
	connecting the callback.
	(create_context_menu): Create a context menu with three actions:
	go to the parent, zoom in and zoom out.
	(initialize_ringschart): Initialize max_depth so we get the
	biggest zoom for the initial ringschart. We also get the gconf
	value for the subfolders tips and create the context menu.

	* src/baobab.h: 
	Added a new struct to manage the context menu. Added also a new
	variable to the baobab_application struct, it is used to store the
	maximum depth of the tree we are representing.
	
	* src/baobab-ringschart.c:
	* src/baobab-ringschart.h: 	
	Added two functions to the API in order to control the new
	feature, adding subfolderstips. If we enable the subfoldertips we
	will see the tooltip for the sector (directory) under the cursor
	and tooltips for "some" of its children. 

	The way the tooltip for the sector under the cursor is painted has
	changed, now the tooltip is not painted all the time, if follows
	the cursor and the user has to stop over the sector.

	Added zoom support to the widget, it is connected to the
	scrolling.

	* src/callbacks.c:
	* src/callbacks.h:	
	(on_rchart_button_release): Callback that handles the context
	sensitive menu.
	(on_move_upwards_cb): Callback for an option in the menu, it tries
	to go to parent of the current directory.
	(on_zoom_in_cb): Callback for an option in the menu, it decreases
	the maximum depth of the ringschart, that way the graphic is
	bigger because we paint less levels.
	(on_zoom_out_cb): Callback for an option in the menu, it increases
	the maximum depth of the ringschart, that way the graphic is
	smaller because we paint more levels.

	* src/baobab-scan.c: 
	Added a new parameter to the allsizes struct in order to calculate
	the depth of the tree.
	(loopdir): Added a new parameter in order to calculate the depth
	of the tree.
	(baobab_scan_execute): Store the maximum depth of the tree we have
	scanned in the application structure. We will use it to calculate
	the proper zoom for the tree.
