What is Baobab
==============

	Baobab is able to scan either specific directories or the whole
    filesystem, in order to give the user a graphical tree representation
    including each directory size or percentage in the branch.
	It also auto-detects in real-time any change made to your home 
	folder as far as any mounted/unmounted device.

    A detailed documentation of the program could be read at:
    http://www.gnome.org/projects/baobab.


System Requirements
===================

Baobab should build on  most unices. It needs the X11R6 (or xorg)
libraries, glib, gtk 2.x, gnome-vfs2, gconf2 libraries.
