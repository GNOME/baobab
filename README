What is Baobab
==============

Baobab is a simple application which can scan either specific folders
(local or remote) or volumes and give a graphical representation
including each directory size or percentage in the branch. It also
auto-detects any mounted/unmounted device.

A detailed documentation of the program could be read at:

    https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Baobab


System Requirements
===================

Baobab should build on most unices. It needs GTK+ 3.


Development
===========

You can check on the current status of Baobab at the git web
interface:

    https://git.gnome.org/browse/baobab/

Comments, ideas and (most of all) bug reports (and especially patches)
are very welcome. Bugs should be reported on GNOME bug tracking
system (https://bugzilla.gnome.org) in the "baobab" component.
