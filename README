What is Baobab
==============

Baobab is a simple application which can scan either specific folders
(local or remote) or volumes and give a graphical representation
including each directory size or percentage in the branch. It also
auto-detects any mounted/unmounted device.

A detailed documentation of the program could be read at:

    https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Baobab


System Requirements
===================

Baobab should build on most unices. It needs GTK+ 3.
