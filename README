What is Baobab
==============

Baobab is able to scan either specific directories or the whole
filesystem, in order to give the user a graphical tree representation
including each directory size or percentage in the branch.
It also auto-detects any mounted/unmounted device.

A detailed documentation of the program could be read at:

    http://wiki.gnome.org/Baobab.


System Requirements
===================

Baobab should build on most unices. It needs GTK+ 3


Development
===========

You can check on the current status of Baobab at the git web
interface:

    https://git.gnome.org/browse/baobab/

Comments, ideas and (most of all) bug reports (and especially patches)
are very welcome. Bugs should be reported on GNOME bug tracking
system (http://bugzilla.gnome.org) in the "baobab" component.
