What is Baobab
==============

    Baobab is able to scan either specific directories or the whole
    filesystem, in order to give the user a graphical tree representation
    including each directory size or percentage in the branch.
    It also auto-detects any mounted/unmounted device.

    A detailed documentation of the program could be read at:
    http://live.gnome.org/Baobab.


System Requirements
===================

Baobab should build on most unices. It needs GTK+ 3
