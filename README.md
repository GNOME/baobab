# Baobab

Baobab is the GNOME [Disk Usage Analyzer](https://apps.gnome.org/Baobab/).

Baobab is a simple application which can scan either specific folders
(local or remote) or volumes and give a graphical representation
including each directory size or percentage in the branch. It also
auto-detects any mounted/unmounted device.
